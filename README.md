## Introduction

We know that soil moisture has important significance for the plant growth. The Capacitive Soil Moisture is designed for it. The capacitance value is changed by the change of dielectric constant caused by the change of humidity between the two plates. The capacitance value can be measured by 555 classical circuit. Please note that the sensor can only measure the relative humidity of the soil, and can not measure the accurate soil moisture value!

## Feature

- Operating voltage: 3.3V~5V 

- Mabee compatible interface 

- Interface: HY2.0-4P
